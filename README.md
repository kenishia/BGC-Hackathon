QEDU Team Project Description

### Team Members:  Michaela Egan, Faith Parker, Hannah Parker

We chose to focus on quality education for our project because of how many people donâ€™t have proper food or educational resources. And even if they make it to college, they may not be able to afford proper supplies.

We are team QEDU, which stands for Quality Education.
The goal of our project was to provide a support center for college students to find resources that they need.
We think this is important because some people do not have funding for school or money for food.  They also may not be able to afford school supplies like textbooks.
What we made was a watsonx chatbot named EdTech that can provide links to places to go to find money, food, and whatever resources the students need.  It asks what they need and where they live.  Resources it provides are things such as internships, scholarships, grants, local food banks, free online textbooks, etc.  EdTech is fast, easy and simple to use like chatting with a friend.
In the future, it could be used to help high school students or even help with homework and provide tutoring.
